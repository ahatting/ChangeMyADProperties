## ChangeMyADProperties

_The tool allows you to change some of your own properties in Active Directory (if you are allowed to)_

**minimal requirements**
- Windows PowerShell version 2
- Domain joined workstation
- Read/Write access to the AD attributes (Without special adjustments you are allowed to change some of your AD properties)

**If you only want the tool and don't care about what the script does, you will only need:**
- ChangeMyADProperties.exe
